        Var declarations are globally scoped or let and const are block scoped. <br>

    var: If we declar a variable from var, then we can also declar it agen with the same name and if we went to re-assign its value then we can do that too. <br>
    let: If we declar a variable with let, then we cannot declare it agen with the same name, but can re-assign its value. <br>
    const: If we declare variable with const, then we can neither declare it agen, nor can re-assign its value.

        Null: When you Want to explicitly assign a value that means absence of value, you assign null.it is to show that the variable has no value. null is an object javaScript.It is a Primitive value in Javascript.  <br>

        undefined: when you just declar a variable, undefined is assigned to a variable by javaScript. it means the value does not exist in compiler. it is the global object.It is a global property.

<!-- Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

Var declarations are globally scoped or let and const are block scoped.

var: If we declar a variable from var, then we can also declar it agen with the same name and if we went to re-assign its value then we can do that too.
let: If we declar a variable with let, then we cannot declare it agen with the same name, but can re-assign its value.
const: If we declare variable with const, then we can neither declare it agen, nor can re-assign its value.



Tell us the use cases of null and undefined -->
<!-- Null: When you Want to explicitly assign a value that means absence of value, you assign null.it is to show that the variable has no value. null is an object javaScript.

undefined: when you just declar a variable, undefined is assigned to a variable by javaScript. it means the value does not exist in compiler. it is the global object. -->
